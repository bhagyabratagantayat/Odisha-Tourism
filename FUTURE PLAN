Bhai, your footer is already looking very professional 👌. Now for your team project (Odisha Tourism website), you can add features that make it stand out in SIH / Hackathon style. I’ll list what features to add + how to mention them in your project report/ppt/demo.

🚀 Features You Can Add

Here are practical features you and your team can build on top of your existing project:

1. Search & Suggestion (Auto-complete)

You already started search bar with suggestions.

Add live search using JavaScript + API (Wikipedia API / your database).

Users can type “Puri” and see suggestions like “Puri Beach”, “Jagannath Temple”.

👉 Mention in project:

“Our platform provides an intelligent search with auto-suggestions to quickly find tourist places in Odisha.”

2. Tourist Places with Cards + Booking

Display tourist destinations as cards (image + description + button).

Add a Booking button → connects to booking page (dummy or real API).

Users can reserve hotel/guide/tour packages.

👉 Mention in project:

“Users can explore tourist spots via interactive cards and directly book their visit.”

3. Interactive Map Integration

Use Google Maps API / Leaflet.js to show Odisha map with pins for major tourist spots.

Clicking on a pin opens details + link to booking.

👉 Mention in project:

“Integrated an interactive map for better navigation of tourist destinations.”

4. Contact & Feedback System

Already you made Contact Form.

Add backend (Node.js/Express + MongoDB) to store feedback or send to admin email via Nodemailer.

👉 Mention in project:

5. Social Media Integration

Already added footer with clickable social links.

You can also show Instagram/Twitter live feed (optional).

👉 Mention in project:

“Social media integration enhances reach and keeps tourists updated.”

6. Responsiveness & Mobile First

Make sure navbar, cards, forms look good on mobile.

Use CSS Grid/Flexbox + media queries.

👉 Mention in project:

“Website is fully responsive and mobile-friendly to ensure accessibility.”

7. Dark Mode Toggle 🌙

Add a button in navbar for dark/light mode switch (using CSS + JS).

Makes UI modern.

👉 Mention in project:

8. Admin Dashboard (Optional, advanced)

Create a simple Admin Panel for managing tourist places, booking data.
